WEB3 ~ ECOSYSTEM (tech: taxonomy & ontology)

SCALING TRILEMMA - Scaling, Security, decentralization

Two types of ROLLUPS: ZKP or Optimistic 

Optimism and Arbitrum are L2 OPERATORS

 SNARK PROOF

 Snarks Plonk

 State Channel and Side Chain

 DHT Distributed Hash Tables - discovery.

 CID - IPFS

Multi-sig wallet Upgradable, Diamonds

LENS. Livepeer

"Super-Creative Ecosystem of Creative Professionals"

cryptography  Symmetric/Asymmetric RSA PGP GPG Cryptographic access to shared data.
SHA256 DIGITAL SIGNATURE 
HASH  Keccak captures STATE, non modifiable 0x.
ELLIPTIC CURVE

CIRCUIT BREAKERS
SPEED BUMPS - time to happen.
RATE LIMITING

Event Monitoring. Tools to help. DEFENDER and Tenderly (monitors).

Shadowing 

Payable

Frontrunning. Oracle Griefing Force-feeding.

HardFork SoftFork


Decentralization sharding rollups Centralized.

WEB SERVICE model vs CRYPTO SERVICE model

MemPools, Genesis Block, Nonce.

Concentrated (cost structure, production)  vs. Distributed (cost structure, production)

public ledger, 

concesus mechanisms BFT - Byzantine Fault Tolerance Concensus Mechanism PoW PoS

Double Spend Problem

DAO, SmartContract

Tenderly 
Waffle Truffle Hardhat - test and deploy smart contracts

IDEs Remix Foundry

Audits Encode

ethers.js web3.js

Standards OpenZeppelin

Wallet, custody of data

Miners - SYBIL RESISTANCE MECHANISM - determines who PRODUCES BLOCK, limits number of ppl.


Key PEOPLE of CRYPTO:
David Chaum, eCash, DigiCash

Yellow Paper VButerin

LIVENESS (property) BLOCKCHAIN will ALWAYS PROCEED.
Never to become STAGNANT. 

Validator  Beacon Chain

 NODE PROVIDERS run EVM.

 Solidity, Vyper

 ABI bytecode

 "Injected Provider"

 MAINNET TESTNET

 SafeMath safetransfer Ownable Bloom Filter

EVM is ‘stack machine’ also ‘register machine’
256bit stack machine.

NON-MUTABLE Storage.

IPFS FileCoin NFTStorage Pinata. NFTUp.

ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOFS - Identity. PoK

Zcash - prove transaction is correct, but do not make public sender, receiver, amount
ZkSync: should bring VISA number of TPS to 1000.
No CENTRAL LEGER. All NODES KEEP STATE. - CONCENSUS.
